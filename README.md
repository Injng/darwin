Implementing some natural selection.

## Game rules
### Strength
Strength is a value between 0 and 100. When multiple entities occupy the same cell, the 
entity with the greatest strength survives. If two entities have the same strength, the
winner is chosen randomly with a 50% chance for each entity.
